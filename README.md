# FizzBuzz game
The Test for Internship developer
---

Hi! new awesome developer, Sphinx gladly welcome you!
Just one step a head, and you can become a Sphinxer, and here it is:

There is a game called FizzBuzz, the players who have to count from 1 to 100. But for the multiples of 3, instead of speaking out the number, the player must say **Fizz**. For the multiples of 5, say **Buzz**. And for the multiples of both 3 and 5, say **FizzBuzz**. Easy, right? So can you

`write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Sphinx” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Software”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “Sphinx Software”`

Please write this program by your favourite progamming languague, however we prefer JavaScript.
